        <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
        <p>
          My name is Linnea and I am 22 years old. I am born and raised here in
          Jönköping. I live together with my partner Oscar and our cat Tellus.
          Tellus is a Bengal cat that is 5 years old, he is very cozy and loves
          to snuggle under a blanket with me. I started to study New Media
          Design because I wanted to work with something creative. At first I
          did not know exactly what I wanted, but then last fall I took a web
          development course where I realised that it was something I really
          wanted to work with. My understanding of web development is still very
          vague, but I look forward to deepen my experience.

        <h2>MY BIGGEST INTEREST</h2>
        <p>
          I spend most of my freetime in the stable. I own a horse called
          Champis, she is 15 years old. I have owned her for 1,5 years, and
          before that I had another horse called Jamie who I had for four years.
          I have been horseback riding since I was 9 years old, and today I can
          not see myself without a horse.
